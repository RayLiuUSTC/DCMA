# code documentation

## The file ‘ols – osqp.r’ is the R code that generates the simulation results of Table 1 in the main text, and Table S2, S3, S6-S12 in the online appendix.

## The file ‘ols_Full_l.r’ is the R code that contains the simulation results of the method ‘Full_l’ in the OLS estimation situation, which corresponds to the ‘Full_l’ columns in Table 1 in the main text, and Table S2, S3, S6-S8 in the online appendix.

## The file ‘ols - M varies.r’ provides the R code that generates the data required for Figure 2 in the main text, and Figure S2-S6 in the online appendix. The file ‘pic_Mvaries_ols.r’ is used for data cleaning and rendering the aforementioned plots with the powerful toolkit ‘ggplot2’.

## The file ‘lasso – osqp.r’ is the R code that generates the simulation results of Table 2 in the main text, and Table S4, S5, and S13 in the online appendix.

## The file ‘pic_CSL_lasso.r’ provides the R code that generates Figure 4 in the  main text.

## The file ‘real-data_lag1_lasso df – osqp.r’ provides the analyzed results of air pollutant data in Section 7 of the main text.

## The air-quality data set used in Section 7 can be found in the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/501/beijing+multi+site+air+quality+data).

## The pdf file 'DCMA-JMLR-2024-Online-Appendices' contains more simulation results related to Section 6.
